# 

# \## 🔒 Status: Frozen Primitive

# 

# This repository contains the final, immutable implementation

# of the BIP-2 deterministic hashing primitive.

# 

# ---

# 

# \## What This Is

# 

# A minimal, deterministic computation unit that performs:

# 

# Normalize → Canonicalize → Hash

# 

# ---

# 

# \## What This Is NOT

# 

# This repository does NOT:

# \- Run a service

# \- Store data

# \- Perform consensus

# \- Interpret hashes

# \- Manage identity

# \- Act as a platform

# 

# ---

# 

# \## Design Principle

# 

# The BIP-2 primitive must remain unchanged, unaware,

# and uninterested in any platform that uses it.

# 

# ---

# 

# \## Usage

# 

# The primitive exposes a minimal CLI for computing

# deterministic hashes from structured input.

# 

# ---

# 

# \## Finality Notice

# 

# This repository is frozen at \*\*v1.2-final\*\*.

# 

# No new features will be added.
